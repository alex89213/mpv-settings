# mpv-settings
My settings for [mpv](https://mpv.io/) on Windows. Will probably need some alterations for use on Mac or Linux.
## Installation
Download one of the Windows builds for mpv [here](https://mpv.io/installation/) and move the folder anywhere you'd like. Then download and unzip this repository and move the portable_config folder into the mpv application folder. Now the entire application will be contained in this folder for easy modification or deletion. Run **mpv-install.bat** within the **installer** folder if you want mpv to be your default video or music player.
